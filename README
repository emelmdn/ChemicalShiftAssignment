- Explain in the github repository the steps to make the experiment reproducible, in addition to explicitly indicating which files are the datasets in the repository.
- Indicate which file (s) correspond to the multiobjective model because I have reviewed the source code and there are models that are not related to the scientific article.

The Chemical Shift Assignment Project

This is the source code of the chemical shift assignment project that is developed on the MOEA framework. ( <http://www.moeaframework.org/>)

The repository contains all the implementation of the MOEA framework. The chemical shift assignment problect is implemented as additional problem on this framework. 
For this reason, this repository contains all the implementation of the MOEA framework, but only some models of this framework is used in the chemical shift assignment project.

The source code of the chemical shift assignment project  is existing in the following path: ChemicalShiftAssignment/src/org/moeaframework/problem/chemicalShiftAssignment/
  - The source code of the chemical shift assignment project are composed of the following files in this branch. 
        Assignment.java
        Atom.java
        AtomType.java
        chemicalShiftAssignment.java: This class is implemented to define the chemical shift assignment problem. It implements already existing Problem interface of the MOEA problem to define our chemical shift assignment problem.
